## Development Workflow

### Frontend Guidelines
- **Animation:** Consider using GSAP for animations (optional).
- **Mapping:** If you need to use maps in your frontend, use the Leaflet library.
- **Images:** If you want to use any images, first create a TypeScript file in the `utils` folder with the name of your page. Export the images from there and use them in your project.
- **Icons:** React Icons library has been installed. Visit their [site](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for the names of the icons.
